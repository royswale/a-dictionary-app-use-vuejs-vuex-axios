## 简介

A Vue.js App Using Axios With Vuex
https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/04/vuejs-app-using-axios-vuex/

> In this tutorial we are building a dictionary application where a user can enter a word and use a RESTful API to retrieve the word’s meaning and information about the word. The user can then either navigate to a word page where they can access more detailed information about the word or they can navigate to a wordlist where all the queried words are listed.
